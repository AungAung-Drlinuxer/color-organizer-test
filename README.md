## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses a two-stage workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

1. **Build Job:**
    - Checks out code
    - Sets up Node.js 18.x
    - Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
    - Builds the app
    - Runs tests
    - Uploads the production build as an artifact
2. **Deploy Job:**
    - Downloads the build artifact
    - Deploys to GitHub Pages using [`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)
    - Publishes to the `gh-pages` branch for public access

Deployment is automatic on every push to `main`.
